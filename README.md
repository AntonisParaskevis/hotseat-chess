# How to Play
1. Enter both players' names in the corresponding fields (or simply use the default ones). Then, click the Start Game button.

2. The player controlling the whites makes the first move, by dragging and dropping their chosen piece on the chessboard. After they're done, they should click their "End Move" button.

3. The player controlling the blacks makes their move, by dragging and dropping their chosen piece on the chessboard. After they're done, they should click their "End Move" button.

4. Each player has a total of 15 minutes to make their moves. During a player’s turn, their timer counts down. When the turn ends, their timer stops and the opponent’s timer starts. If a player’s time runs out, they lose the game and their opponent is declared the winner.

5. Keep taking turns until either player checkmates their opponent, the game ends in a draw, or a player’s time runs out.
