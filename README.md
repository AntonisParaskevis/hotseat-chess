• Enter both players' names in the corresponding fields (or simply use the default ones). Then, click the Start Game button.

• The player controlling the whites makes the first move, by dragging and dropping their chosen piece on the chessboard. After they're done, they should click their "End Move" button.

• The player controlling the blacks makes their move, by dragging and dropping their chosen piece on the chessboard. After they're done, they should click their "End Move" button.

• Each player has a total of 15 minutes to make their moves. During a player’s turn, their timer counts down. When the turn ends, their timer stops and the opponent’s timer starts. If a player’s time runs out, they lose the game and their opponent is declared the winner.

• Keep taking turns until someone checkmates, the game ends in a draw, or a player’s time runs out.
